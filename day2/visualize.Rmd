# install and/or load packages for this session
- `install.packages()`: "Download and install packages from CRAN-like repositories or from local files."  
- `library()`: loads your package you installed  
- **best practice note.** `install.packages()` downloads files from the internet, so it's "polite" to "comment out" (# = comment) this code before you share it with people so they don't download files they don't really want by accident.

# how do I answer research questions with plots?
- **use ggplot2.**
- **ggplot2 metaphor.** think of a ggplot2 plot like a "map of the world" that you build one layer at a time.
- imagine a map of the world without land (i.e., water only).
- now imagine adding "layers" (e.g., continents, colors, mountains, legends). ggplot2's kinda like that.
